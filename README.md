# Machine-Learning-Practice
Practice with Machine Learning algorithms in Python, including: 

- Data Preprocessing strategies
- Simple Linear Regression 
- Multiple Linear Regression 
- Polynomial Regression 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest 
- Support Vector Regression 

I will update as I learn more methods and algorithms for different types of learning problems.
